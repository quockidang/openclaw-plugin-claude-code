## Why Use This Plugin?

### Use Your Claude Max Credits

Have a Claude Max subscription? This plugin lets you use your existing subscription credits for agentic coding tasks instead of paying per-token API costs. Your OAuth credentials are securely passed to containerized Claude Code sessions.

### Contain the Blast Radius

Claude Code with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` can modify any file and run any command. This plugin contains each session in a rootless container with:

- All Linux capabilities dropped
- Configurable network isolation
- Memory and CPU limits
- Optional AppArmor profiles

Bad code, infinite loops, or accidental `rm -rf` stays inside the container. Your host system remains untouched.

### Parallel Workspaces

Run multiple Claude Code sessions simultaneously, each in its own isolated workspace. Sessions maintain state across interactions, enabling complex multi-step workflows without interference.

### Works With Any OpenClaw Agent

Any OpenClaw agent can use the `claude_code_start` tool to offload coding tasks. The orchestrating agent stays lightweight while Claude Code handles the heavy lifting in its own container.

## FAQ

### Why Podman instead of Docker?

**Security.** This plugin runs AI-generated code with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` — the container is your only safety net. Podman is rootless by default: no daemon, no root process, no privilege escalation path. If an AI agent escapes the container, it lands in an unprivileged user namespace with no capabilities.

Docker's default mode runs a root daemon. A container escape from a root-daemon Docker setup gives the attacker **full root access to the host**. Docker *can* run rootless, but it requires [additional setup](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/) and isn't the default. Most Docker forks of this plugin skip that step.

The plugin supports `runtime: "docker"` for users who have configured rootless Docker, but Podman is strongly recommended.

### Why use this plugin instead of the coding-agent skill?

The built-in [coding-agent skill](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/main/skills/coding-agent/SKILL.md) is a prompt that teaches an OpenClaw agent to delegate coding tasks using the platform's existing `bash` and `process` tools. It's lightweight, supports multiple agents (Codex, Claude Code, Pi), and requires zero setup beyond loading the skill.

This plugin solves a different problem: **containment**. When Claude Code runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, it can modify any file and run any command. The coding-agent skill runs those agents directly on your host (or in OpenClaw's sandbox), while this plugin runs each session in a rootless Podman container with all capabilities dropped, resource limits enforced, and `/tmp` mounted as tmpfs.

**Use the coding-agent skill when:**
- You want multi-agent support (Codex, Claude Code, Pi)
- Quick setup matters more than isolation
- You're already comfortable with OpenClaw's sandbox mode
- Tasks are short-lived and don't need session persistence

**Use this plugin when:**
- You're running Claude Code with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` and want real containment
- You need persistent sessions that survive across multiple interactions
- You want structured job management (status, output pagination, activity detection, crash recovery)
- You're running untrusted or experimental code and need hard resource limits

They can also work together: an agent could use the coding-agent skill for quick Codex tasks while routing longer Claude Code sessions through this plugin for isolation.

## Features

- **Isolated Execution**: Each Claude Code session runs in its own container with dropped capabilities
- **Real-time Streaming**: Output is captured as it's generated using Claude Code's stream-json format
- **Session Persistence**: Sessions maintain state across multiple interactions
- **Dual Authentication**: Supports both API key and OAuth/Claude Max credentials
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable memory, CPU, and PID limits
- **AppArmor Support**: Optional AppArmor profile for additional security hardening
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Idle sessions are automatically cleaned up

## Requirements

- [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) >= 2025.1.0
- [Podman](https://podman.io) (recommended) or Docker
- Node.js >= 22

## Installation

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "enabled": true,
    "load": {
      "paths": ["path/to/dist/index.js"]
    },
    "entries": {
      "claude-code": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "image": "ghcr.io/13rac1/openclaw-claude-code:latest",
          "runtime": "podman",

        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `image` | string | `ghcr.io/13rac1/openclaw-claude-code:latest` | Container image for Claude Code |
| `runtime` | string | `podman` | Container runtime (`podman` or `docker`) |
| `startupTimeout` | number | `30` | Seconds to wait for container to produce first output |
| `idleTimeout` | number | `120` | Kill container after this many seconds of no output |
| `memory` | string | `512m` | Memory limit for containers |
| `cpus` | string | `1.0` | CPU limit for containers |
| `network` | string | `bridge` | Network mode (`none`, `bridge`, `host`) |
| `sessionsDir` | string | `~/.openclaw/claude-sessions` | Directory for session metadata |
| `workspacesDir` | string | `~/.openclaw/workspaces` | Directory for session workspaces |
| `sessionIdleTimeout` | number | `3600` | Cleanup idle sessions after this many seconds |
| `apparmorProfile` | string | `""` | AppArmor profile name (empty = disabled) |
| `maxOutputSize` | number | `10485760` | Maximum output size in bytes (10MB default, 0 = unlimited) |
| `notifyWebhookUrl` | string | `http://localhost:18789/hooks/agent` | OpenClaw webhook URL for notifications |
| `hooksToken` | string | `""` | Webhook auth token (must match OpenClaw `hooks.token` to enable notifications) |

## Authentication

The plugin supports two authentication methods:

### 1. OAuth / Claude Max (Recommended)

If you have Claude Max or enterprise OAuth credentials, place your credentials file at:

```
~/.claude/.credentials.json
```

The plugin mounts your `~/.claude` directory directly into each container session, so OAuth token refreshes persist automatically.

### 2. API Key

Set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

**Note**: If both are available, OAuth credentials take precedence.

## Job Completion Notifications

The plugin sends webhook notifications when jobs complete. No polling required.

### Setup

Enable webhooks in OpenClaw config (`~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`):
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "enabled": true,
    "token": "your-secret-token"
  }
}
```

The plugin automatically reads the token from the OpenClaw config file. When a job completes, fails, or is cancelled, the agent receives a message with the job status, duration, and output size.

### Sandbox Tool Allowlist

If you use OpenClaw's sandbox mode (`sandbox.mode: "non-main"` or `"all"`), webhook-triggered agents run in a sandboxed context with restricted tool access. To allow the agent to use this plugin's tools, add them to your sandbox tool allowlist in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "sandbox": {
      "tools": {
        "allow": [
          "exec", "process", "read", "write", "edit", "apply_patch", "image",
          "sessions_list", "sessions_history", "sessions_send", "sessions_spawn", "session_status",
          "claude_code_start", "claude_code_status", "claude_code_output",
          "claude_code_cancel", "claude_code_cleanup", "claude_code_sessions"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

See [Multi-Agent Sandbox & Tools](https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools/multi-agent-sandbox-tools) for more details on sandbox tool policies.

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions when a version tag is pushed.

### Prerequisites

1. Configure `NPM_TOKEN` secret in GitHub repository settings
2. Ensure you have push access to the repository

### Release Process

1. Update version in `package.json`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with release notes
3. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git add package.json CHANGELOG.md
   git commit -m "chore: release v1.x.x"
   ```
4. Create and push a version tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.x.x
   git push origin main --tags
   ```

The release workflow will automatically:
- Run tests
- Publish to npm with provenance
- Build and push multi-arch container images to ghcr.io

## Troubleshooting

### Container image not found

```
Error: Container image not found: ghcr.io/13rac1/openclaw-claude-code:latest
```

Pull or build the container image:

```bash
podman pull ghcr.io/13rac1/openclaw-claude-code:latest
```

### No authentication available

```
Error: No authentication available. Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or have ~/.claude/.credentials.json
```

Either:
1. Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable, or
2. Place OAuth credentials at `~/.claude/.credentials.json`

### Startup timeout

```
Error: startup_timeout - No output within 30 seconds
```

The container failed to start or produce output. Check:
- Container image is valid
- Sufficient system resources
- Network connectivity (if `network: bridge`)

Increase `startupTimeout` if needed.

### Idle timeout

```
Error: idle_timeout - No output for 120 seconds
```

Claude Code stopped producing output. This may indicate:
- Task completed but output wasn't captured
- Claude Code is stuck
- Task requires more time (increase `idleTimeout`)
